            "Preprocessing refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to the algorithm. Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis. For achieving better results from the applied model in Machine Learning projects the format of the data has to be in a proper manner.\n",
            "Scikit-learn provides a library of transformers, which may clean, reduce, expand or generate feature representations.\n",
            "Standardization of dataset\n",
            "Data standardization is about making sure that data is internally consistent; that is, each data type has the same content and format. Standardized values are useful for tracking data that isn’t easy to compare otherwise. Standardization of datasets is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators implemented in scikit-learn.  Feature Scaling or Standardization is a step of Data Pre Processing which is applied to independent variables or features of data. It basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range. Sometimes, it also helps in speeding up the calculations in an algorithm. There are two common ways to get all attributes to have the same scale: min-max scaling and standardization.\n",
            "Standardization\n",
            "The result of standardization (or Z-score normalization) is that the features will be rescaled so that they’ll have the properties of a standard normal distribution with μ=0 and σ=1 where μ is the mean (average) and σ is the standard deviation from the mean; standard scores (also called z scores) of the samples are calculated as follows: z= (x−μσ) Standardizing the features so that they are centered around 0 with a standard deviation of 1 is not only important if we are comparing measurements that have different units, but it is also a general requirement for many machine learning algorithms.\n",

For example a person could have  features [\"male\", \"female\"], [\"from Europe\", \"from US\", \"from Asia\"], [\"uses Firefox\", \"uses Chrome\", \"uses Safari\", \"uses Internet Explorer\"]. Such features can be efficiently coded as integers for instance [\"male\", \"from US\", \"uses Internet Explorer\"] could be expressed as [0, 1, 3] while [\"female\", \"from Asia\", \"uses Chrome\"] would be [1, 2, 1]. Typically, any data attribute which is categorical in nature represents discrete values which belong to a specific finite set of categories or classes. To convert categorical features to such integer codes, we can use the OrdinalEncoder. This estimator transforms each categorical feature to one new feature of integers (0 to n_categories - 1)\n",

            "Another possibility to convert categorical features to features that can be used with scikit-learn estimators is to use a one-of-K, also known as one-hot or dummy encoding. This type of encoding can be obtained with the OneHotEncoder, which transforms each categorical feature with n_categories possible values into n_categories binary features, with one of them 1, and all others 0. While one-hot encoding solves the problem of unequal weights given to categories within a feature, it is not very useful when there are many categories, as that will result in formation of as many new columns, which can result in the curse of dimensionality.\n",

            "Power transforms are a family of parametric transformations that aim to map data from any distribution to as close to a Gaussian distribution in order to stabilize variance and minimize skewness. In many modeling scenarios, normality of the features in a dataset is desirable. Power Transforms currently provides two such power transformations, the Yeo-Johnson transform and the Box-Cox transform. Box-Cox can only be applied to strictly positive data.\n",

To address this issue, a bagging technique was applied, where two detection models were used in a single inference. This improved the performance of the model, allowing it to detect all 10 plants in a frame, achieving 100% accuracy for plant detection.\n",

Additionally, I researched how to add parameters in Lambda but faced limitations due to the AWS CLI.\n",
